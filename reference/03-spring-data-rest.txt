For Spring Data REST, we only need 3 items

1. Entity: Employee
2. JpaRepository: EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository
3. Maven POM dependency for: spring-boot-starter-data-rest


Spring data rest use plural form of entity:
employee -> employees, etc...
Does not handle complex case of language:
goose -> geese, tooth -> teeth
We need to specify plural name/path with an annotation
